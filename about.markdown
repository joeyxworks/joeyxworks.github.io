## Hello world! 

I am Joey, I have been a network engineer for more than 7 years. Engineer I think is one of the most interesting jobs in the world, engineers create the world in some sense, and I am proud to have been an engineer in my life. 

This blog is the way that I can better show my work to the world. I think everyone has several parts inside, they can do engineering work in their workstation, and also be a cooker at home, you do not need to “sprout” yourself. I will show all my aspects in this site to complete learn-teach loop in the future adventure.

There are several topics I am interested in as an amateur for now:
- Running
- Cycling
- Languages for Web Developing (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Raspberry Pi
- Guitar

ALWAYS EXPLORING...
